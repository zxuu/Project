      "“Afterward #Jesus found him in the temple,and said to him,”See,you have been made well.Sin no more,lest a worse thing come upon you.”\\n(#John 5:14)\\n\\nAfter we are baptized  and especially after we receive the #HolySpirit, we should not make iniquities.\\n\\n“For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth,there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,but a certain fearful expectation of judgment,and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries.”(#Hebrews 10:26-27)\n",
      "“Now,therefore ,listen to me,my children,\\nFor blessed are those who keep my ways.\\nHear instruction and be wise,\\nAnd do not disdain it.\\nBlessed is the man who listens to me,\\nWatching daily at my gates,\\nWaiting at the posts of my doors.\\nFor whoever finds me finds life,\\nAnd obtains favor from the #Lord;\\nBut he who sins against me wrongs his own soul;\\nAll those who hate me love death.”\\n(#Proverbs 8:32-36)\n",
      "Every day most of us have something to worry about. All around us, people look or are afraid, anxious, worried, and stressed out... Are you worried or upset about something that might happen? Something tomorrow or in the future that you really aren’t in control of?\\nI understand that feeling too. But #God says: “Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.”( #Matthew 6:34, NIV)\\nIf we’re worried about tomorrow, we could miss today’s joy and blessings.\n",
      "When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. They will never follow a stranger...(John10:4-5 NIV)\\nThe stranger refers to the thief, and also to the devil and his servants. Only Jesus is our good shepherd. “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full”.(John 10:10) The devil is the father of lies and also the king of this world. He uses lies to deceive and control the world. So we must know very well the Word of God in the Bible in order to recognize the voice of Jesus and follow Him. In this way we can also recognize the enemy's lies and stay away from the fake news, so that we will not be hurt and our lives will not be lost.\n",
      "“Riches do not profit in the day of wrath,\\nBut righteousness delivers from death.”\\n(#Proverbs 11:4)\\n\\nHere Whose “wrath” does it refer to? It is of #God:\\n“Now the great city was divided into three parts,and the cities of the nations fell.And great Babylon was remembered before #God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath.”(#Revelation 16:19)\\n\\nWealth can not save us from our sins;But #God can.\\nPlus,it is not easy especially for the rich to enter the heaven.\n",
      "Nothing is impossible for #God\\nAbraham was 99 years old when the Lord told him that within a year, he would have a son. He and Sarah were too old to have a baby. It was so far out that when Sarah heard it, she laughed out loud. Has God ever put something in your heart that seemed so unlikely or so big that your first reaction was to laugh? He whispers in your spirit that you’re going to live in a nice neighborhood, see your family restored, or get your health back, etc. If Abraham had only looked at it logically, he would have given up. But Abraham did what we all must do: He #believed. “Yes, it’s impossible, but God can do the impossible...” Whatever looks impossible in your life, God will finish what He started. What was true of Abraham is true of you and me.\n",
      "“Then they said to the woman,”Now we believe,not because of what you said,for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the #Christ,the savior of the world.”(#John 4:42)\\n\\nIf we are chosen to be saved  before we are determined to seek for Him,after we hear the gospel from other people,then our life in Him starts.\\nOur faith grows up and stronger along with that we believe more of His words and put them in our life.This is a foundational way to know our #LordJesus.\\nThe more we know Him (#Ephesians 1:17),the closer we are to Him (#James 4:8),then the more we are alike Him.\n",
      "“Come,see a Man who told me all things that I ever did.Could this be the #Christ?” (#John 4:29)\\nWe are not very possibly capable of remembering everything we did before,but #LordJesus recorded for us.Then what is the point to record it all?\\n\\nWhen we live,He guides us:\\n\\n “Your word is a lamp to my feet \\nAnd a light to my path.”(#Psalm 119:105);\\n\\nWhen we die, He gives us judgment:\\n\\n“For #God will bring every work into judgment,\\nIncluding every secret thing,\\nWhether good or evil.”(#Ecclesiastes 12:14)\\n\\n#God gives us not only the life on earth, but also the eternal life in heaven.\n",
      "Everything happens according to #God’s will and #timing.\\nWhen we’re tempted to get discouraged by what is happening in our lives, remember that we’re not living on your own. God is behind the scenes. God’s strong hand and outstretched arm are not limited by the natural; He’s #supernatural. We can’t see Him, but He’s behind the scenes, and He controls the universe. He’s working all things according to His will and timing, and for our good. Suppose God is ready to promote you, He doesn’t need to check with your boss. He opens the door. He controls things behind the scenes. So don’t lose sleep over your boss or the people who are against you. His hand is over them. Your steps are divinely guided by God.\n",
      "The Bible says: Our iniquities have separated us from God; our sins have hidden His face from us. So when we come to God, we must first examine ourselves, confess our sins and repent. “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.”(#1John 1:9) We must also tremble at the Word of God. We draw close to God in accordance with God's Word, not our own thoughts or feelings. “Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith...”(#Hebrews 10:22) God will make His face shine upon us and be gracious to us. He will take care of us and give us His peace and joy.\n",
      "“But above all,my brethren,do not swear,either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath.But let your “Yes” be “Yes”,and your “No”,”No”,lest you fall into judgment.”(#James 4:12)\\nThis is a very practical teaching which we can apply in our daily life. Humans got the mood and emotions, which sometimes need to stretch out a bit, but if we remember this teaching, then we enjoy the power from these words to put our mood under control and to keep us away from the possibility to sin.\n",
      "“Having been born again,not of corruptible seed but incorruptible,through the word of #God Which lives and abides forever,because:\\n‘All flesh is of grass,\\nAnd all the flory of man as the flower of the grass.\\nThe grass withers,\\nAnd its flower falls away,\\nBut the word of the Lord endures forever. ‘\\nNow this is the word which by gospel was preached to you.”(#1Peter 1:25)\\nAfter being baptized in His name with faith in #LordJesus ,we are reborn in Him. Our bodies were formed of the dust of the ground,(#Genesis 2:7) but it  is His word to make us obtain the eternal life,which Adam lost due to his disobedience of His commandment.(#Genesis 2:16)\n",
      "After Adam and Eve #sinned, they hid from the LORD God. We are all sinners. But God doesn’t want us to hide from Him, not to seek His face and to continue to live in sin. By the #blood of Jesus, God wants us to bravely seek His face, confess our sins and repent. “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will #forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.”(1John 1:9) God has #compassion on His children and on our weakness, and He helps us overcome our sinful nature. “Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.”(Heb 4:16)\n",
      "“Do not be overly righteous,\\nNor be overly wise:\\nWhy should you destroy yourself?\\nDo not be overly wicked,\\nNor be foolish:\\nWhy should you die before your time?\\nIt is good that you grasp this,\\nAnd also not remove your hand from the other;\\nFor he fears #God will escape them all.”\\n(#Ecclesiastes 7:16-18)\\nWith #LordJesus in us, we do not walk in front of #God,but to follow Him;\\nWithout Him in us, we do not make iniquities too heavy or too much,otherwise we can not enter His grace or even die before the normal days He gave us.\n",
      "#God always knows the way we should go and knows how many trials we can endure. Trust Him that He is making a way. We all go through valleys — difficult times in life. Don’t give up when it feels like you’re in the valley. Look up to Him, and draw from Him endless power and #grace. He is our best friend and is our help at any time. God wants to bring us out stronger than before.\n",
      "We are taking the road of #grace, with #God’s support and blessings along the way. Although there are the mountains or valleys in front of us, He will lead us through with His love. So live a joyful life every day and don’t worry about tomorrow. #Cast all anxieties, worries and weaknesses onto Him. We must live positively and trust that He will also prepare enough strength, peace and comfort for us, if difficulties and challenges come to us. Even greater blessings will be waiting ahead. He is God who #fulfills His #purpose for us.\n",
      "“Who(#God ) has saved us and called us with a holy calling,not according to our works,but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in #Jesus #Christ before time began,but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior #Jesus #Christ ,Who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,”\\n(#2Timothy 1:9-10)\\nHere are some points of this verses:\\n1:Our works can not save us,no matter how kind or nice we think we are.\\n2:Love comes from #God ,He is love and He loves us even before the time began.Therefore He blesses us with the grace in His purpose.\\n3:#Jesus is our #Christ ,Who has come and left,revealing to the world His grace.\n",
      "“For Your name’s sake,O Lord,\\nPardon my iniquity,for it is great.”(#Psalm 12:11)\\n\\nWhat is His name? It is #Jesus! \\n“And she shall bring forth a Son,and you shall call His name #Jesus,for He will save His people from their sins.”(#Matthew 1:21)\\n\\nHis name is great to save everybody:”And in His name Gentiles will trust.”(#Matthew 12:21)\n",
      "“Deliver those who are drawn toward death,\\nAnd hold back those stumbling to the slaughter.”(#Proverbs 7:11)\\n#LordJesus tells His disciples to evangelise:“But you shall receive power when the #HolySpirit has come upon you;and you shall be witness to Me inJerusalem,and in all Judea and Samaria,and to the end of the world.”(#Acts 1:8)\n",
      "“And when I passed by you and saw you struggling in your own blood, I said to you in your blood,’Live!’Yes,I said to you in your blood,’Live!’(#Ezekiel 16:6)\\n“And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember the days of your youth,when you were naked and bare,struggling in your blood.”(#Ezekiel 16:22)\\nWhen people left #God ,we were trapped in the world iniquities, which made our souls exposed  “naked and bare”,struggling to survive in the punishment by #God . But #God didn’t leave the people beloved by Him completely,He looks after them like a father to a son. However we humans, are so easy to forget the punishment and so weak and vulnerable before iniquities that we even don’t feel ashamed to continue to crook our souls recklessly.\n",
      "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with #God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. (#John1:1-2) The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of #grace and truth. (#John1:14) From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. (#John1:16)\n",
      "We have our errors and hidden faults(or called blind spots)that we don't know. Therefore, we must always pray to #God and let God shine upon us. Then we can see if there is any offensive way in us. Otherwise our guilt remains. Job was a righteous man and he also had blind spots. The bible says: Job justified himself rather than God. Job had his hidden pride(Job 30:1-2). He didn’t start “seeing”God until he was completely #humbled and admitted that he had his errors and hidden faults and repented. “My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.”(Job 42:5) “After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again”(Job 42:10). We also have to seek God’s face with a humble and contrite heart in order to let God shine upon us and be blessed.\n",
      "“And the devil said to Him,’All this authority I will give You,and their glory;for this has been delivered to me,and I give it to whomever I wish.Therefore,if you will worship before me,all will be Yours.’ ”(#Luke 4:6-7)\\n\\nHere the devil,again as usual,lied and cheated. Find the answer here if you could give it some thoughts first:\\n“Do not love the world or the things in the world.If anyone loves the world,the love of the #Father is not in him.”(#1John 2:15)\\n\\nThat’s why #LordJesus answered the devil:”Get behind Me,Satan!For it is written,’You shall worship the #Lord your #God,and Him only you shall serve.’ “(#Luke 4:8)\n",
      "It is necessary and essential to study the #Scriptures of the Bible, but it does not necessarily bring us life. 2 Corinthians 3:6 tells us: “He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the #Spirit gives #life.”“The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.”(John:6:63) “#God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.”(John:4:24) “For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.”(Psalms:36:9) \\nOnly in this way can we get life from the fountain of the living water.\n",
      "“Then #Jesus returned in the power of #Spirit to Galilee,and news of Him went out through all the surrounding region.”(#Luke 4:14)\\nIf we want to serve in church,preach to people,do the work for #God,and especially if we want people to be saved by #God in the way which #God has directed us,we need to receive the #HolySpirit,Who then gives us enough power to fulfill the job in a Holy way.When people are filled with the #HolySpirit, they are undefeatable by the devil,as we can see from what happened to #LordJesus.(#Luke 4:1-13)\\nAs John the baptizer says:”For He Whom #God has sent speaks the word of #God,for #God does not give the #Spirit by measure.”(#John 3:34)\n",
      "Sometime there are dark times in our lives. We don’t see how we will ever get well from illness, or ever get out of debt, or we don’t see how to resolve the legal situation. Here’s the key: we are the #righteous and the children of the Most High God. #God gives us the #promise . That is when it’s dark, when we are probably discouraged, when we feel like giving up, light is about to burst in. That means God in His goodness will turn it all around. When it’s time for promotion, for healing and for abundance, all the forces of darkness cannot stop God. The light is about to break through the darkness. We just keep believing and keeping trusting in Him.\n",
      "“If someone says,‘I love #God ,’and hates his brother,he is a liar;for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen,how can he love #God Whom he has not seen?And this commandment we have from Him:that he who loves #God must love his brother also.”(#1John 4:20-21)\n",
      "O #God , you are my strength and my #salvation !\\nThis chapter (#Isaiah 12:1-6 ) is a hymn of praise and a picture of people rejoicing in the reign of Jesus #Christ on earth. It is now that we are to express our gratitude to God. We are to thank Him, praise Him and tell others of His wonderful deeds. It is out of our gratefulness that we must also share the #gospel with others.\n",
      "Those who resist the truth may not know that they have been taken captive by the devil. “#God wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.”(#1Timothy 2:4)  He is ready to give everyone a chance to accept the truth. Therefore, the children of God should share the truth patiently and gently, so that people will come to their senses and accept Jesus #Christ as their #Savior . But if they are stubborn and reject it, there's no need to force them. “Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.”(#Matthew 7:6)\n",
      "“If I regard iniquity in my heart,\\nthe #Lord will not hear me.”(#Psalm 66:18)\\nProphet Isaiah understood it this way:\\n“Behold,the #Lord ’s hand is not shortened,that it cannot save;\\nneither his ear heavy,that it cannot hear:\\nBut your iniquities have separated between you and your #God ,\\nand your sins have hid His face from you,that He will not hear.” (#Isaiah 59:1-3) \\nAfter #LordJesus left,James put iniquities as this:”But every man is tempted,when he is drawn away of his own lust,and enticed.Then when lust has conceived,it brings forth sins:and sin,when it is finished,brings forth death.”(#James 1:14-15)\n"

The Walls of War: The multi-trillion dollar ongoing cost of Afghanistan, Iraq and other interventions. The crumbling walls of the U.S. infrastructure, which need at least $3 trillion to be repaired or replaced. A wall of 11 million undocumented immigrants, whose deportation could easily cost $200 billion. The planned wall at the Mexican border, which some estimates place at $67 billion. Then there is the Wall of All, the $20 trillion national debt. The walls of debt are closing in.\n",

      "The same article indicates the Founders anticipated having to borrow money on the full faith and credit of the United States. Enter the Funding Act of 1790, which assumed and paid off the debt of the colonies and retired the financial obligations of the newly created states now united. This was a powerful, object lesson in debt retirement, relevant today.\n",
      "It is abundantly clear from a plain reading of the coinage clause that the Founders never intended that the only way the government was to be funded was to borrow money.\n",
      "The needs of the nation were to come from a system of not borrowing wherein money was a neutral value of exchange connecting resources, people and needs, without debt attached.\n",
      "In 1913, the passage of the Federal Reserve Act ceded the constitutional power to create money (and control of our national destiny), to the Federal Reserve, a quasi-private central bank. At this fateful point, the only way money could be brought into being was to borrow it, whereby money became equated with debt. The money system transited from public control to private control, and there it has remained.\n",
      "Instead of following the path set forth by the Founders to create money directly, our government became obliged to borrow from private banks, which assumed the sovereign power to create money from nothing and then loan it to the government, turning on its head the intention of the Founders.\n",
      "As a member of Congress, I came to the conclusion that while the debate over taxation was interesting, it was wholly insufficient. One must first study how money is created, before one can sensibly have a discussion of how it is to be taxed.\n",

      "The vehicle was H.R. 2990, the National Emergency Employment Defense (NEED Act), which articulates why the current debate over the debt ceiling should lead directly to a debate about monetary policy, and the origins of the debt-based economic system.\n",
      "In our work on the NEED Act, we propound that the present monetary system has led to a concentration of wealth, expansion of national debt, excessive reliance on taxation, devaluation of the currency, increases in the cost of public infrastructure, unemployment and underemployment and the erosion of the ability of Congress to meet the needs of the American people.\n",
      "This system has been a source of financial instability where the banks' ability to create money out of nothing has become a financial liability for the American taxpayers. When banks engaged in speculative lending, turning the financial system into a casino, they were bailed out while millions of Americans lost their homes. No surprise that today we are told there is not enough money for creating jobs, rebuilding America, health care, education and retirement security. But there is always money to bail out the banks.\n",
      "Let us take the opportunity afforded in the debate over the debt ceiling to regain control of our sovereignty and our national destiny. We can have a future of abundance instead of poverty, but we must first take down the wall which separates us from our true sovereignty, the power to coin and create money.\n",
      "Let us return to first principles, and reclaim the constitutional power to coin and create United States money and spend it into circulation to meet the needs of the nation and reduce taxes.\n",

Wade. This makes Planned Parenthood the biggest mass murderer in the history of the world. Is she willing to have a serious conversation about that? Where is her outrage over that?\n",
